# About

This is my personal vim configuration along with some information about vim usage.

The config is common for both vim and neovim.

Essential resources:

- [Vim documentation](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/)
- [Drew Neil's Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/)
- [Derek Wyatt's Video Tutorials](http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/)
- [Tim Pope's plugins](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Atpope+vim)

# Normal mode - dot to repeat the last command

`.` (dot) - repeat the last normal-mode command, automatic mini-macro.

# Normal mode operators, motions and text objects

[:h navigation](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html)

## Operators

`[operator]{motion}` - apply [:h operator](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#operator) to the text defined by motion.

For example: `<G` - shift everything right until the end of file (`<` - right shift operator, `G` - end of file motion), `gg=G` - format the whole file (gg - jump to the top, `=` - format operator, `G` - end of file motion).

- `c` - change
- `d` - delete
- `y` - yank into register (does not change the text)
- `J` - join lines, `gJ` - join lines without adding a space between them
- `~` - swap case (only if 'tildeop' is set)
- `g~`- swap case, visual mode `~`
- `gu`- make lowercase, visual mode `u`
- `gU`- make uppercase, visual mode `U`
- `!` - filter through an external program
- `=` - text indenting, using `equalprg` or internal function
- `gq`- text formatting, using `formatexpr` or `formatprg` or internal function
- `g?`- ROT13 encoding
- `>` - shift right, visual mode `>>`
- `<` - shift left, visual mode `<<`
- `zf`- define a fold
- `g@`-  call function set with the 'operatorfunc' option

More info: [how to define own operator, :h :map-operator](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/map.txt.html#%3Amap-operator), [how to define own motion, :h omap-info](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/map.txt.html#omap-info).

## Motions

### Left-right motions
```
Left-right motions

    Pudding—Alice: Alice—Pudding.
          *
0   ^    h l      gm            g_   $
                        25|
```

Here `*` is a cursor position, `h` / `l` move one char right / left (can also take count), `0` - move to line start and so on. The `[count]|` moves to the specified column.

When the line is wrapped, `g^` moves to the start of screen line.
The `gm` depends on the window width and moves to the center of the screen line.

Jump to the char with `f` / `t`, `F` / `T`, `f` jumps forward to the char and `t` jumps forward till the chars (stops just before it); the `F` and `T` do the same backwards.

```
f/t, F/T jump to char

    Pudding-Alice: Alice-Pudding.
     |    *    |        |
     Fu        fc       tP
     TP
```

### Words and WORDs

Words (letters, digits and underscores, can be configured with `'iskeyword'`) and WORDS (any non-blank chars):

```
Words and WORDs

    ┌┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┐ ┌┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┐ ┌┈┈┈┈┈┈┐ ┌┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┐ - WORDS
    ┌┈┈┈┈┈┐┌┈┐ ┌┈┈┈┐┌┈┈┐ ┌┈┈┈┐┌┈┐ ┌┈┈┈┈┈┐┌┈┐ - words
    Pudding--- Alice:::: Alice--- Pudding...

    Pudding--- Alice:::: Alice--- Pudding...
             ┆     ┆   ┆ *   ┆  ┆

             ┆     ┆
             2gE   2ge ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈  two words / WORDs back
```

### Up-down motions

```
  Up-down motions ...                        gg
  ...
  But the Red Queen looked sulky,
  and growled                                k - line up, `+` - up and move to the start
  'Pudding—Alice: Alice—Pudding.     *
  Remove the pudding!'                       j - line down, `-` - down and move to the start

  and the waiters took it away so quickly    :+3   - range is a motion, c:+2, d:107
  that Alice couldn't return its bow.        /bow  - search is a motion, c/bow
  ...
  ...                                        G
```

Note that `:` can be in general used as motion, not only to specify the range: `d:call search('f')` will delete until the next 'f' found by search() function.

There is also `[count]_` motion which moves `count-1` lines down and jumps to the start. It is like a `^` motion, but with count. If there is no count or count=1 it moves to the current line start, with count > 1 moves down and jumps to the start.

The `[N]%` jumps to the N% of the file, `:[range]go[to] [count]` and `[count]go` jump to the `count` byte in the file.

### Text object motions / various motions

```
Matching pair () {} []    - % - move to the matching pair, make sure to enable the
              /**/          matchit.vim (standard plugin), ":h matchit.txt"
              <tag></tag>
              if/else/endif
              etc

A sentence.               - ) / ( - [count] sentences, like y3) - yank 3 sentences

A paragraph of
text.                     - } / { - [count] paragraphs

A section                 - ]] / [[ - [count] sections, see [:h section](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#section),
                          can be redefined by filetype plugins, like move between
                          classes / methods in python.
End of the section        - ][ / [] - [count] end of section

Unmatched (               - [( / ]( - prev/next unmatched (
Unmatched {               - [{ / ]{ - prev/next unmatched {
Unmatched #if / #else     - [# / ]# - prev/next unmatched {

A method of the class     - [m / ]m, and [M / ]M move to the end of the method

A block comment /*  */    - [*, [/ / ]*, ]* - prev / next comment mark

[n] lines from the top    - [n]H
[n] lines from the bootom - [n]L
Middle line               - M
```

Each of them can be used as an operator target.

For example `c%` - change until the matching pair:

```
    if (x and y or something(b, c))
                   *
                   |
                   c% - from here it will find the bracket pair around
                        the "b, c" and will jump to the matching (end parent)
    if (x and y or ▓)

    link_to(""text"", my_p(sing(""one""), plu(fn(""two""))))
                      *   A                               B
                      |
                      c%   --- from here will change until B
                      %c%  --- will change the A-B, including brackets
                      %ci( --- here will change inside the A-B
```

See also [Vim's life-changing c%](http://thepugautomatic.com/2014/03/vims-life-changing-c-percent/).

### Text object selection

```
 word, word_two          - aw / iw (regular / inner text object)
 WORD, word--%4-         - aW / iW

 'string'                - a' / i'
 "string"                - a" / i"
 `string`                - a` / i`

 A sentence.             - as / is

 A paragraph of
 text. It also has a
 text object.            - ap / ip

 [ block ]               - a[, a] / i[, i]
 ( block )               - a(, a), ab / i(, i), ib
 < block >               - a<, a> / i<, i>
 { block }               - a{, a}, aB / i{, i}, iB
 <tag>value</tag>        - at / it
```

More text objects: [wellle/targets.vim](https://github.com/wellle/targets.vim), [indent object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object), [column object](https://github.com/coderifous/textobj-word-column.vim).

The quotes text objects (a', a", etc) look forward if the cursor is not inside the quoted string. Like if cursor is on the `*` position in `text [*] text 'quote'`, the `ya'` will yank the quoted word.
The [wellle/targets.vim](https://github.com/wellle/targets.vim) makes other text objects also look forward (and then also backward if there is no object forward).

Inner text objects (`iw`, `iB`, etc) do not include the surrounding marks.
For words this is trailing space, for blocks - brackets.

```
"aw" vs "iw" vs "w"

    ┌┈┈┈┈┈┈┐   - yaw - yank word with trailing space - "Pudding "
    ┌┈┈┈┈┈┐    - yiw - yank only word - "Pudding"
    Pudding Alice
```

Note: motions like `yw` and `yaw` do the same and yank the word with the trailing space (same for `daw`, `caw`, etc), but it will be a bit different in visual mode. The `vaw` will also select the first letter of the next word (because `w` actually moves to there).
It works in a similar way for other objects, like sentences.
See also [:h exclusive](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#exclusive).

### Motions and operators

There are 3 types of the effects of operators: `characterwise`, `linewise`, `blockwise`.

And `*wise` can be varied by operator and motion:

- `dw` - characterwise - delete a word
- `>j` - linewise - indent 2 lines
- `dj` - linewise - delete 2 lines

It is possible to force *wise with the following keys:

- `v` - characterwise
- `V` - linewise
- `<C-v>` - blockwise

Usage: {operator}{*wise-specifier}{motion}, see [:h o_v](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#o_v):

- `dvj` - characterwise
- `dVj` - linewise
- `d<C-v>j` - blockwise

See also: [operator, the true power of Vim](http://whileimautomaton.net/2008/11/vimm3/operator).

# Marks

[:h mark-motions](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#mark-motions).

- `a-z` - local marks (inside the buffer), reset when buffer is deleted
- `A-Z` - global (across files)
- `0-9` - automatically set from .viminfo, '0 - cursor position on last exit from Vim, '1 - previous exit, and so on, see [:h viminfo-file-marks](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/starting.txt.html#viminfo-file-marks)

Set the mark with `m{a-zA-Z}`.

Jump to the mark:

- ``'{a-z} `{a-z}`` - jump to mark in the current buffer, with ' - to the mark location, with ` - to the first non-blank char
- ``'{A-Z0-9} `{A-Z0-9}`` - jump to mark in the file (may be another file, not a motion in this case)

Jump to the mark is a motion (can be used with operators).

List of marks - `:marks`.

Delete marks with `:delm`:

```
:delm a - delete mark `a`
:delm a b or :delm ab - delete marks `a` and `b`
:delm p-z - delete all marks from `p` to `z`
:delm! - delete all marks for the current buffer (only a-z, not A-Z and 0-9)
```

# Normal mode - jump list and change list

## Change list

- `g;` / `g,` - move back / forward the [change list](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#changelist), view the list `:changes`
- `gi` - jump to last edit and start the insert mode (uses `'^` mark)
- `'.` - jump to last edit position

## Jump list

- `<C-O>` / `<C-I>` - move back / forward in the [jump list](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#jumplist), `:jumps`
- `''` / `` - jump to the previous place you jumped here from
- `gf` - open file under cursor
- `gd` / `gD` - local / global variable definition
- `C-]` - jump to the tag
- `C-^` - switch between two recent files
- `[num]<C-^>` - switch to 'num' file (see file numbers in :buffers)

## Special marks

```
'[ `[ / '] `]   - first / last char of last changed / yanked text
'< `<` / '> `>  - first / last char of last visual selected text
''  ``          - previous jump position
'" `"           - position before exiting the buffer (useful when re-open it)
'^ `^           - last insert mode position
'. `.           - last edit position
[' [` / ]' ]`   - [count] previous / next lowercase mark
```

# Insert / command mode editing

- `<C-H>` - delete prev char
- `<C-W>` - delete previous word
- `<C-U>` - delete current line, this often used in mappings to clear the command line, for example to remove the automatic `'<,'>` when there is a visual selection

# Insert mode editing

- `<C-T>` / `<C-D>` - indent / un-indent, useful for markdown lists
- `<C-E>` / `<C-Y>` - insert char above / below the cursor
- `<C-A>` / `<C-X>` - increment/decrement number under the cursor
- `g<C-A>` in visual mode - sequentially increment values in a column
```
                  1                1                1
                  1 -- select --> |1| -- g<C-A> --> 2
                  1               |1|               3
```
- `<C-O>` - execute normal command and get back to insert mode

[:h insert.txt](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/insert.txt.html)

# Insert / command mode - insert from the register

`<C-R><r>` - insert the text from the register.

Examples:

- `<C-R>0` (zero) - paste yanked text
- `<C-R>"` - paste the text from the unnamed register

If we have "Hello" in the `a` register and "World" in the `b`, we can insert them like this:
`"ap"bp` from normal mode.

But it is easy to do from the insert mode `<C-R>a<C-R>b` and change will be repeatable with dot.

# Insert / command mode - calculate the expression and insert the result

`<C-R>=` - prompt for the expression and insert it

```
<C-R>=3*0.65  -- will insert 1.95
```

# Insert mode - insert the last text

`<C-A>` - Insert the last inserted text.

Example:

```
"some_text(...)
cf(new_text"      - change "some_text" to "new_text" till the (

"some_text, ...   - now we need to do the same change, but till the comma
ct,<C-A>"        - we enter the new command `ct,` and then use Ctrl-A to insert new_text
```

There is also `<C-@>` - Insert the last inserted text and stop the insert mode.

# Insert mode autocompletion

- `<C-N>` / `<C-P>` - generic completion, [:h i\_CTRL\_N](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/insert.txt.html#compl-generic)
- `<C-X><C-O>` - omni-completion, :h ins-completion
- `<C-X><C-L>` - lines
- `<C-X><C-F>` - file names, based on `:pwd`
- `<C-X><C-]>` - tags
- `<C-X><C-K>` - dictionary
- `<C-X><C-N>` - keywords in current file
- there are more, see [:h ins-completion](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/insert.txt.html#ins-completion)

Work with autocomplete menu:

- <C-p> / <C-n> Use the prev/ next match from the word list (next match)
- <C-y> Accept the currently selected match (yes)
- <C-e> Revert to the originally typed text (exit from autocompletion)
- <C-h> (and <BS>) Delete one character from current match
- <C-l> Add one character from current match

Open the popup without selecting the first item: <C-N><C-P> (will actually select the first item and then un-select it).

# Insert mode complete whole lines

Complete whole lines with `<C-X><C-L>`:

- type some text, do `<C-X><C-L>`
- if there are few suggestions - type a bit more and `<C-L>`
- now you at the end of line, and complete mode is still active
- press `<C-X><C-L>` few more times to get more lines which follow the line you've got

From [Let Vim Do the Typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX3kV3TICU).

Similarly it is possible to complete sentences word-by-work with `<C-X><C-P>`.

# Command line window

It is super-useful to edit long commands, or search patterns.

- `q:` - opens a command-line window.
- `q/` - opens a search history window.

From the command line / search prompt - press `<C-F>` to switch to the command-line window.

Don't re-map the `q:`:

If you often invoke it accidentally, you probably have a problem with entering `:q` correctly. In this case whether remap the `:q` to something else (for example, to `<Leader>q`) or type it like this: left pinky - Shift, right pinky - ':', left pinky - 'q' (there is no chance to type it backwards this way).

# Visual mode

In normal mode - `v` / `V` / `<C-V>` - char / line / block visual mode.
Same keys in visual mode switch between selection modes.

In normal mode `gv` - re-select the last visual selection (very useful).

In visual mode:

- `o` - move to other end of the selection
- `gv` - switch current and previous visual selection
- `c` - change the selection (can re-paste after the change with `<C-R>"`, convenient for wrapping)
- `d` - delete the selection
- `r` - replace the selection with entered char

In visual block mode:

- `O` - move to other corner on the same line
- `$` - select until the end of line, will work for all lines even if length is different
- `A` / `I` - append / prepend the block with entered text

Visual block + $ - selects a non-rectangular block. Then use `A` to append to the end of lines.

Alternative: do `A` on one line, then select a block and repeat with `:'<,'>normal .`.

Select function body (between { and }): `vaBV` - select "a block" and then change the selection mode to line-wise.
To select 2 levels up - `v2aBV` (when inside other {} block inside function) or `vaBaB` (repeat `aB` to move to the next block).
A mapping to work from any level inside the function: `:map t ? function <CR>f{vaBV` (search backwards for `function`, move to the `{` and then do `vaBV`).

# Show full file name and stats

- `<C-G>` - normal mode, show current file name and path and cursor position
- `<g C-G> - show file stats (numer of columns, lines, words, bytes)

# Calculator: expression register

In insert mode, `Ctrl-R=` will prompt for the expression and insert the result into the document.

It can also be convenient to have the expression in the document, then copy it and insert when prompted. The insert operation will be in command-line mode and we can do it using `Ctrl-R"` (in cmd mode, Ctrl-R inserts the given register value).

For example:

```
Document:
5+5*2       | ^ v $ y       - go to start, select until end, copy
5+5*2=      | A = Ctrl-R =  - append, enter =, Ctrl-R = to invoke prompt

Command line:
=           | Ctrl-R "      - insert the copied expression
=5+5*2      | Enter

Document:
5+5*2=15

cos(1.57)=7.963267e-4
```

See `:help i_CTRL-R_=`, `:help c_CTRL-R`, `:help registers`.

# Digraphs and special chars

- `<C-K>{char1}{char2}` - insert a digraph (normal mode)
 - [alpha digraphs](./vim/digraph-alpha.txt)
 - [symbol digraphs](./vim/digraph-symbol.txt)
- `<C-V><key>` - insert the key literally (like <C-V><Tab> always inserts tab, regardless of 'expandtab' option).
- `<C-V>{code}` - insert the unicode char literally by decimal code
- `<C-Vu>{code}` - insert by hex code
- `ga` - show ascii value of char under cursor
- `g8` - show utf-8 byte sequence for char under cursor

`:dig` - show digraphs

# Manage Files

- `set path=.,**` - set path to recursively look through the sub-directories.
- `:find **/filename or :e **/filename` - search for the file and open it.
- `:find **/filename<TAB>` - display the list of matching files and move through them

- `:saveas new_name` - make a copy with `new_name` and switch to that copy
- `:saveas Ctrl-R %` - will insert the current file name, useful if new file name is similar to the current file name (also the following <C-F> can be useful to edit the new name in the command-line window)
- `:w new_name` - make a copy, but don't switch to it
- `:drop file_name` - open file or jump to already opened version
- `:set switchbuf += useopen` + `:sbuffer path/to/file"` -  with ['useopen'](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27switchbuf%27) option will also search for already open buffer and jump to it (also affects quickfix)
- `:hardcopy` - print the file

The ['tpope/vim-eunuch'](https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch) adds more commands to manage files (like Remove, Move, Chmod, Find, SudoWrite, and others).

# Netrw

- `<F1>` - open netrw help (use <C-^> or <C-O> to get back)
- `-` - go to the parent dir, `<CR>` - open a file
- `R` - rename file
- `d` - create dir
- `mf` - mark file, `mF` - unmark file, `mu` - unmark all files, `qF` - mark quickfix files
- `:MF pattern` - mark files by pattern, `mr` - query for pattern and mark files
- `mt` - mark target dir (or `:MP dir`), mark files, `mc` - copy files (`mm` - move)
- `mg` - vimgrep marked, `mz` - compress / decompress, `mx` - apply shell command, `md` - diff, `mp` - print
- `qf` - file info
- `<del>`, `D` - delete file or dir (marked files if there are any, visual selection if any)
- `gh` - hide / unhide dot files
- `i` - switch view mode (thin / long / wide / tree)
- `s` - sorting style
- `p` - preview the file
